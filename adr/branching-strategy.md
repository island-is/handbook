# Branching/release strategy

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: devs, devops
* Date: 2020-05-24

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we want to organise work in branches and how should changes be released? How should different branches be continuously deployed for QA?

## Decision Drivers

* We need to have confidence in our releases.
* We want more structured releases while we're still getting our footing in a shared monorepo.
* It should work well with our agile work environment.

## Considered Options

* [Git Flow]
* [GitHub Flow]
* [OneFlow]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "OneFlow" because it provides a single eternal branch with well structured releases.

We'll implement OneFlow with these details:

* Release branches are set up the Monday after each sprint.
* Release and quality managers from each team are responsible for reviewing and approving releases.
* Releases apply to all apps in the monorepo.
* Releases are versioned like this: `1.{sprint}.<hotfix>`. So version 1.32.2 is the release after sprint 32, with two hot fixes applied.
* Feature branches are merged using "Squash and merge", so they can be easily reverted.
* Feature branches should be short-lived. Features that are not ready to go live should instead be disabled with feature flags.
* If a project needs to deploy updates outside of the sprint rhythm, they should use hotfix branches.

Later we may embrace GitHub Flow, with continuous deployment into production, but only when we get enough confidence in our monorepo CI/automatic testing setup.

### Continuous deployment

Environment | CD                    | Databases/services | Features
------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------
dev         | master                | Test               | All
staging     | master                | Prod               | All
pre-prod    | release/hotfix branch | Prod               | Finished
prod        | latest release tag    | Prod               | Finished

In addition to these, we also want CD for feature branches, but this has additional requirements/complications so it's out of scope for now.
