## Digital Iceland Handbook

This GitHub organization is the center of development for digital government
services on `island.is`. It is managed by the [Digital Iceland] department
inside the [Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs].

These services will be [FOSS] and open to contributions, but most development
will be performed by teams that win tenders to develop new functionality for
Digital Iceland.

This handbook is designed to help new teams and open source contributors get
into the project, as well as document project architecture and decisions.
