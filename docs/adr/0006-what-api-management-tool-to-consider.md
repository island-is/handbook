# What API Management tool to consider

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: TBD
* Date: 2020-06-11

Technical Story: Design of Api Gateway / API Portal

## Context and Problem Statement

Is there available tool that is compliant to requirements?
Can the tool provide functionality for API Gateway?
Can the tool provide functionality for API Development Portal? 

## Decision Drivers

* Vendor lock in for runtime
* Open source or not
* Installation options
* Functional ability
* Market presence

### Functional ability for decision

Functional ability to consider when evaluating the tool. The following list was taken from [wikipedia page for API Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management).

* Gateway: a server that acts as an API front-end, receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service and then passes the response back to the requester. A gateway often includes a transformation engine to orchestrate and modify the requests and responses on the fly. A gateway can also provide functionality such as collecting analytics data and providing caching. The gateway can provide functionality to support authentication, authorization, security, audit and regulatory compliance.
* Publishing tools: a collection of tools that API providers use to define APIs, for instance using the OpenAPI or RAML specifications, generate API documentation, manage access and usage policies for APIs, test and debug the execution of API, including security testing and automated generation of tests and test suites, deploy APIs into production, staging, and quality assurance environments, and coordinate the overall API lifecycle.
* Developer portal/API store: community site, typically branded by an API provider, that can encapsulate for API users in a single convenient source information and functionality including documentation, tutorials, sample code, software development kits, an interactive API console and sandbox to trial APIs, the ability to subscribe to the APIs and manage subscription keys such as OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret, and obtain support from the API provider and user and community.
* Reporting and analytics: functionality to monitor API usage and load (overall hits, completed transactions, number of data objects returned, amount of compute time and other internal resources consumed, volume of data transferred). This can include real-time monitoring of the API with alerts being raised directly or via a higher-level network management system, for instance, if the load on an API has become too great, as well as functionality to analyze historical data, such as transaction logs, to detect usage trends. Functionality can also be provided to create synthetic transactions that can be used to test the performance and behavior of API endpoints. The information gathered by the reporting and analytics functionality can be used by the API provider to optimize the API offering within an organization's overall continuous improvement process and for defining software Service-Level Agreements for APIs.
* Monetization: functionality to support charging for access to commercial APIs. This functionality can include support for setting up pricing rules, based on usage, load and functionality, issuing invoices and collecting payments including multiple types of credit card payments.

## Decision Outcome

Based on the option to run the API Management tool on premise, the following options have been pinpointed for further analysis.

If open source options are not a requirement, it is suggested to evaluate the following tools.

* [Mulesoft Anypoint](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api-management)
* [Software AG API Management](https://softwareaggov.com/products/integration/webmethods-api-management/)
* [IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/api-connect)
* [Axway Ampify](https://www.axway.com/en/products/api-management) 
* [Tibco Mashery](https://www.tibco.com/products/api-management)
* [Nginx Plus](https://www.nginx.com/)

These are the tools that are most mature, and do not provide lock in for runtime platform. 
They need to be evaluated based on pricing and technical ability.

If true open source is required, it is suggested to evaluate the following tools.

* [Kong](https://konghq.com/)
* [Red Hat 3Scale](https://www.3scale.net/)
* [Tyk](https://tyk.io/)
* [WSO2](https://wso2.com/api-management/)

These tools provide open source offering, but in most cases the features for Api Developer Portal and Publishing tools are only part of enterprise offering with subscription.
Evaluation is needed for validating if the open source offering of the tool contains what is needed for implementation. 
We need to evaluate pricing of enterprise offering against the price of creating/implementing required pieces, like custom Api Developer Portal. 

For all considered tools we need to check what underlying software components are required. For example, data storage, queuing and logging capacity.
We need to take into consideration effort and ability to build Developer portal, compared to customizing the tool offering.

Downside for 

* [Google Apigee Edge](https://apigee.com/about/cp/open-source-api-management)
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/api-management/) 
* [Microsoft Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/)

is that they are all platform dependent, to the owners proposed platform with more limited on-premise options. These are all top of the line tools according to capabilities, so
if vendor lock was not one of the decision drivers, they would be on evaluation list.

Other tools that we looked at did in our opinion lack functionality or other ability for further considered, even though many of them could be considered.
Note that the list provided is not all existing Api Management tools, so other options might apply.

### Positive Consequences

* Api Management tools are listed and grouped based on if they have open source option or not.
* This is first phase of decision on what tool could help implementation on Api Management Platform, and narrow down options to consider.

### Negative Consequences

* Follow up is required on tool that will make the shortlist.
